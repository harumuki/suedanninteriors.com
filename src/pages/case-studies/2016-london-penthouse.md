This apartment is made up of the top two floors of a nine story building with a large roof terrace
close to The City of London

The original d√©cor of the apartment was plain and dated and the layout on the top floor did not
make best use of the views. The kitchen being at the terrace end of the apartment and the seating
area at the back.

There was one family bathroom with a bath and W.C.and the smaller bedroom had a tiny ensuite
with a tiny shower.

The spiral staircase was filled in and dark.

In order to make the most of the light and the views we decided to relocate the kitchen to the rear

of the upper floor, apply for Planning Permission for an additional widow, rebuild the structure onto
the patio and put in bi-fold doors.

We also took out the existing spiral staircase and commissioned a bespoke open tread walnut and
steel structure.

We redesigned the bathrooms to create more room in the smaller ensuite and create a new large
ensuite shower room for the master bedroom.

The whole apartment was gutted and new lighting, plumbing and air conditioning installed.
The apartment also had extensive AV treatment in every room including TVs, Lutron lighting., Sonos
speakers etc.

The roof terrace was also renovated with new composite decking and glass balustrade.

The apartment now has stunning views from the open plan living area and has a very modern
contemporary feel.

The spiral staircase is a real feature on the lower floor and there are two luxurious bedrooms with
stylish ensuites. New bespoke walnut internal doors were also fitted on the lower floor and bespoke
walnut lined wardrobes.
