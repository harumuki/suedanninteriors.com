My clients came to me in the summer of 2017 with this project.

They had purchased two x 2 bedroom apartments on the 4th and 5th floors of a 5 storey building in
Val D’Isere– the top one being the penthouse with large vaulted ceilings.

The idea was to knock through from below, insert a staircase to make a 4 bedroom duplex
apartment.

In order to obtain planning permission to pierce the floors we had to use the builders who had
constructed the whole building originally. They were based in Chambery.

The window for any construction or building works in the Ski Resorts is very small – 1 st May to 31 st
November so we had to work very quickly to produce all the designs before we could secure
contracts with the builders.

Both of the apartments were stripped back to the concrete shells and all the new interior walls,
wiring, plumbing and cladding were added.

We created 3 bedrooms with ensuites and a Jack and Jill Steam Room with shower to be used by the
4th bedroom.

Most interior walls were clad with Larch and some plastered, some stone feature walls were also
added.

The main sitting room now has a 4 metre high vaulted ceiling with a 3 metre wide drop down
projector screen and a stunning full height stone clad fire.

The kitchen and bathroom carpentry was all made from locally sourced Antiqued Fir and the floors
all Oiled Oak.

There are fake fur throws and luxurious rugs everywhere creating a cosy atmosphere.
