We have used Sue Dann Interiors twice now to advise us on the new design and refurbishment of our homes, and cannot recommend her highly enough. Her attention to detail, whether of design or on the financial side, was thorough and professional. She spent a lot of time familiarising herself with our own tastes and ideas, then provided us with a huge range of choice and alternatives, which resulted in beautiful and functional interiors.
