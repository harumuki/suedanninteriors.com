This was our third project with Sue Dann Interiors, so we were even more confident from the outset
that we would work well together and an added bonus was that Sue speaks fluent French so could
easily liaise with the French Builders and trades working on the project.

Once again Sue created a look which was based on our preferences of style and comfort and she
tailored her designs giving us plenty of options.

She also used a variety of local materials to produce classic but contemporary Ski Chalet interiors.
The basis of Sue’s designs are always top quality timeless items which allows the accessories and
accents to be changed easily in the future to create new fresh looks when needed.

We would happily recommend her company to anyone wishing to invest in the French Alps.
