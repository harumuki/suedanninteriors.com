This was our second project with Sue Dann Interiors so we were confident from the outset that we
would be able to work together harmoniously and that Sue would also be supervising the Project
Coordination with the builders and other trades.

The Project took some time to get underway as we had to deal with Planning Permission and
Permission to Alter but Sue and her team kept us updated at all times and once we had all the
necessary documents work progressed quickly.

Sue always tailors her designs to suit our tastes and lifestyles whilst enhancing the property and
making the most of the space.

She created a modern open plan living space on the top floor opening onto a sun filled terrace with
stunning views over London and two luxurious bedrooms on the lower floor, both now with stylish
ensuites.

We now have a wonderful stylish ‘Pied a Terre’ for the whole family to enjoy in central London and
the work carried out has added much value to the property.
